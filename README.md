## What is this?

`tapetide-mcp` is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects AI assistants to real-time Indian stock market data. It covers all ~8,200 stocks listed on NSE and BSE — from large-cap Nifty 50 to SME stocks.

Ask your AI to look up any stock, run a screener with 326 fundamental filters or real-time technical indicators, pull quarterly financials, check analyst consensus ratings, track your portfolio P&L, monitor FII/DII institutional flows, or get today's bulk deals — all through natural language.

This is the Python distribution, for setups that already run Python or `uv` and would rather not install Node.js. It is functionally identical to the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tapetide-mcp) ([source](https://github.com/Tapetide-hq/nse-bse-indian-stock-market-data-mcp)) and has **zero runtime dependencies** — standard library only.

**Compatible with:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro, VS Code, Codex, Zed, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Antigravity, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Quick Start

1. Get a free token at [tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add the server to your MCP client.

### With uvx (recommended — no install step)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tapetide": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["tapetide-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TAPETIDE_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

[Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if you don't have it: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

### With pip

```bash
pip install tapetide-mcp
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tapetide": {
      "command": "tapetide-mcp",
      "env": {
        "TAPETIDE_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`python -m tapetide_mcp` works too, if the console script isn't on your client's `PATH`.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add tapetide -e TAPETIDE_TOKEN=your_token_here -- uvx tapetide-mcp
```

### Codex CLI (`~/.codex/config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.tapetide]
command = "uvx"
args = ["tapetide-mcp"]
env = { TAPETIDE_TOKEN = "your_token_here" }
```

### No local install at all

Chat apps (claude.ai, chatgpt.com, Grok, Gemini) can connect straight to the remote server — add `https://mcp.tapetide.com/mcp` as a custom connector and sign in with Google.

> **Python 3.10+** required for the local option.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐   stdio (JSON-RPC)   ┌──────────────────┐     HTTPS      ┌─────────────────────┐
│  AI Assistant   │ ◄──────────────────► │  tapetide-mcp    │ ◄────────────► │  mcp.tapetide.com   │
│  (Claude, etc.) │                      │  (this package)  │                │  (remote server)    │
└─────────────────┘                      └──────────────────┘                └─────────────────────┘
```

The package is a lightweight stdio bridge. It:

- Reads JSON-RPC from stdin, forwards it to the remote Tapetide MCP server, writes responses to stdout
- Auto-detects framing: newline-delimited JSON or Content-Length framed
- Exchanges your refresh token for a 1-hour access token and refreshes it before expiry
- Unwraps SSE responses from the remote server
- Identifies your MCP client to the remote via `User-Agent`, echoes the negotiated protocol version, and replays the `Mcp-Session-Id`
- Warns on stderr when the server rate-limits a call

All 55 tools run on the remote server. Because the bridge forwards JSON-RPC verbatim, new tools are available the moment they ship — no package upgrade needed.

## Authentication

| Method | How it works | Best for |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Google OAuth** | Browser sign-in, automatic token refresh | AI chat apps (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) |
| **Personal Token (remote)** | `Authorization: Bearer tpt_rt_...` header | Clients with URL-based MCP (VS Code, Kiro, Zed) |
| **Personal Token (local)** | `TAPETIDE_TOKEN` env var via uvx/pip | stdio MCP clients (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Codex) |

## Tools

> Tip: ask your assistant to call `read_me` first. It returns the full in-session guide — every
> tool by category, usage patterns, and the rules the server expects clients to follow.
>
> Three tools carry an interactive view for hosts that support [MCP Apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps)
> (Claude, Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot): `get_price_history` renders the price and volume chart,
> `market_heatmap` the index treemap, and `screen_stocks` the sortable results table. Text-only hosts
> get the same JSON result with nothing missing.

<!-- tools:start — mirrors the server's tool catalog. Checked against the live server's tools/list by
     scripts/check_catalog_parity.py (CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml). When the catalog changes,
     regenerate this block; do not hand-edit an individual count. -->

### Retired tool names

These names were removed. Calling one returns a message naming its replacement, so a client can
recover in the same turn — but new integrations should use the replacement directly.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TAPETIDE_TOKEN` | Yes (local) | — | Personal API token from [tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens) |
| `TAPETIDE_MCP_URL` | No | `https://mcp.tapetide.com` | Override remote server URL |
| `TAPETIDE_DEBUG` | No | `0` | Set to `1` for debug logging to stderr |

## Rate Limits

Limits are per Tapetide account and identical across all three access methods (OAuth, remote token,
and this Python bridge) — they follow your plan, not your transport.

| Scope | Free plan | Paid plans |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Per day | 50 tool calls | Per your plan |
| Per calendar month | 1,000 tool calls | Per your plan (unlimited on enterprise) |
| Burst | 60 tool calls per minute | 60 tool calls per minute |

Only **successful tool calls** consume quota. Protocol traffic (`initialize`, `tools/list`) and
burst-denied calls are free. Daily and monthly windows reset on IST boundaries.

When a limit is hit, the server replies with a normal JSON-RPC result carrying `isError: true` and a
message naming the binding cap and its reset time, so your assistant relays it instead of retrying.
Responses carry `X-RateLimit-Reset`, and denials add `Retry-After`. The numeric quota itself is not
exposed as a header — check current usage at
[tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `TAPETIDE_TOKEN is not set` on a tool call | The bridge starts without a token so tools can be listed, but calls need one. Add it to the `env` section of your MCP config |
| `Token refresh failed (401)` | Token expired. Generate a new one at [tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens) |
| `Rate limit exceeded` | Wait for reset (shown in error) or check usage at [tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens) |
| Server not responding | Ensure Python 3.10+ (`python3 --version`) or `uv` is installed |
| Slow first request | Normal — pre-authenticates on startup. Subsequent requests are fast |
| Network errors | Check internet. The bridge needs to reach `mcp.tapetide.com` |

Set `TAPETIDE_DEBUG=1` for detailed logging to stderr.
